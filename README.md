# Reminder
Reminder is one of my first major C# projects, the aim of which is to create an app that reminds the user when their favourite TV Shows, Movies and games are being released.

*Concept

I'll be utilising the [The Movie Database](themoviedb.org) API for TV and film data and [RAWG](https://rawg.io/) for game data. Data will be saved locally for now but hoping to be able to backup data to an SQL database at some point. A background task will confirm that the saved info is the same as the API information and then check the current date to the release date and notify if it is the same.

I might all the user to decide when and how you will be notified.
