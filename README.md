# Reminder
Reminder is one of my first major C# projects, the aim of which is to create an app that reminders the user when their favourite TV Shows, Movies and eventually games are being released. I'll be utilising the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API to fetch the title information and use SQL to store chosen titles. A background task will confirm that the saved info is the same as the API information and then check the current date to the release date and notify if it is the same. I might all the user to decide when and how you will be notified.
